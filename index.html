					<p>&#128197; The First Interaction - We were both little kids, innocent and carefree. One night at 1 AM, I sent a message in the all-chat of PUBG, which led to a friend request from you. We played our first game together, exchanging simple greetings like "Hey" and "Hello." After that, I sent you a request, but you didn‚Äôt accept it immediately. The next day, you finally accepted, marking the beginning of our friendship.</p>
					
					<p>&#128197; The Beginning of Our Friendship - In the early days, you used to ignore me. Whenever I sent a request, you wouldn‚Äôt accept it. You played with your other friends while I waited. One night, after you rejected my request again, I messaged you personally, saying, "If you don‚Äôt want to play, just unfriend me; I‚Äôm already frustrated." That was the moment you finally replied, and from there, our real friendship started.</p>
				
					<p>&#128197; Late Night Chats & Motivation - As we continued talking, our conversations became more frequent, especially at night. You motivated me a lot, and we started playing together regularly. However, there was a friend of yours who kept us from getting too close. You played with him more and even kicked me out of the group at times. Despite all that, you were still my best friend.</p>
				
					<p>&#128197; Breaks & Waiting for You - There were times when you had to take breaks from the game due to your studies. I would check daily to see if you were online, hoping to talk to you. Sometimes, you would come online for just a day after 90 days. It continued like this until one day, I got a message from you on Instagram.</p>
				
					<p>&#128197; Our Bond Grew Stronger - After that, we started talking daily on Instagram. One day, when I didn‚Äôt message first, you asked me to. That‚Äôs when our bond became even stronger. We talked daily, and over time, we became close‚Ä¶ closer‚Ä¶ and eventually, besties. Those were the best days of my life‚Äîchatting late at night, laughing, sharing happy and sad moments together.</p>
				
					<p>&#128197; The Best Day of My Life - The most unforgettable day of my life was March 18, 2024, the day I saw you for the first time. That moment will always be my favorite memory. I can never forget it.</p>
				
					<p>&#128197; Hard Times & A Hopeful Future - Over time, our friendship faced struggles, mostly because of my mistakes. Things changed, and we drifted apart. But I still cherish every moment we spent together. Now, we are busy in our lives, and though we don‚Äôt talk as much as before, whatever little time we do get together is still special to me.</p>
				
					<p>&#128197; A Promise - No matter what happens, I will always value our bond. I truly miss our late-night chats, our fun, and everything we shared. Maybe one day, we‚Äôll return to being the same besties again. Until then, I‚Äôll always be here, hoping for that time to come back. &#10084;&#65039;</p>
